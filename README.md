## 😇About the repository
This Repository is created on purpose to get open-source contribution and include the project on hacktoberfest 2022. As name suggest the repo belongs to an app created using flutter.

## 📢General Steps to follow while contributing:

### Step Zero
- Look for issues already submitted in the __Issues__ tab, and comment "I want to work on this issue"
- Wait till the owner of the repo assigns you the issue, and then your'e good to go
- For one or more contributor on same issue best PR will be only merged.
- If you want to add solution for a problem of your choice, "Create a new issue, submit and comment to work on the issue"

### Step One
- Once you are assigned the issue, fork the repo to your profile 🍴 by clicking the __Fork__ button on the top right corner 
- Clone the repo to your local machine: ```$ git clone "your cloned repo URL"``` run the command in git bash on your PC/ Mac 💻
- Now you can make the particular change or add something your own code in the file/folder

### Step Two
- After succesfully following the above steps, open Git Bash on your PC/ Mac.
- Create a new branch and checkout the branch: ```$ git checkout -b "branchname"``` ( ___Always try to make changes on a new branch rather than directly on the master branch, which can corrupt the codebase while working on some high profile, complicated program___) 
- Add files changed: ```$ git add .```
- Commit the changes: ```$ git commit -m "commit message"``` (commit message should be meaningful and precise, example: __git commit -m "changing the css of home button"__)
- Verify the code by testing on your side on emulator / real device according to your preference. 
- Push the changes to make a successful PR: ```$ git push origin your-branch-name```
- That's it 🎉💥
